Cyfrowa Biblioteka Druków Ulotnych pols- kich i Polski dotycz acych  ̨ z XVI, XVII i XVIII w., CBDU: http://cbdu.id.uw.edu.pl) was from the very beginning planned to be set up as a proof of concept validat- ing the idea of making a thematic digital library a platform for co-operation of researchers with the possibility of storing the research results very closely related to the original digital object. CBDU comprises about 2,000 pre-press documents dated between 1501 and 1729. At that time, before Polish newspapers started regular circulation, ephemeral prints — short, disposable and occasional informative publications — were playing a significant part in the development of Polish writing, serving as the most influential media of the time. The scope of the materials is Poland-related, which combines the Polish sources with prints published abroad, concerning the Republic of Poland, political, religious and military issues (e.g. the reports or letters on the famous relief of Vienna in 1683, see e.g. Figure 1), but also sensa- tional facts or canards. The materials were prepared “live”, mostly by participants or observers of the reported events and as such they are valuable sociological source of information on mechanisms of spreading information at that time, its reception, propaganda and readers’ interests. This variety is reflected in diversity of topics, layouts and language variants. The digital library was created with the intention of provid-12ing public online access to all preserved and described in the literature pre-press documents. The prints were identified, scanned from microfilms (since the original speci- mens are preserved in libraries all over Europe), converted into DjVu (Bottou et al., 1998) format and saved in a EPrints-based system (EPrints, 2010) (see (Ogrodniczuk and Gruszczyński, 2011) for a more detailed description of the process). Currently over 70% of the prints are available as DjVu images.The above-mentioned reasons influenced our decision that CBDU prints will be available not only as scanned versions of original objects, but also in other, related forms such as transliterated or transcribed text. In the future we also plan to offer translations of foreign-language prints into Polish. Each of these versions will be synchronized with all other layers so that they can be viewed simultaneously when needed. To clarify this scenario, let’s assume that the user decided to see the scanned version first (see Figure 2). It apparently contains letters or words difficult for an inexperienced user. However, the system offers the transliteration possibility, which yields: Such form is helpful, but still not very reader-friendly. For users unfamiliar with Polish who would like to get rough understanding of the content, it is also insufficient since e.g. automated translation into English does not recognize many words belonging to old Polish: Such problems are overcome when transcription of text is offered (by default — to contemporary Polish). The following version is almost perfectly understandable by an ordinary user of Polish:Poc zyna śie Hi torya o pora zc ze Sákrámentar- zow y zábićiu wodzá ich Kśi a  ̨ z ećiá de Conde.The History conceives of pora zc ze Sákrámentar- zow killing their leader s prince de Conde.Poczyna si e historia o pora zce sakramentarzów i zabiciu wodza ich Ksi a  ̨ z ecia de Conde. and can be further automatically translated: Begins the story of the failure sakramentarzów and killed their chief prince de Conde.The last persisting problem is the inflected outdated word sakramentarz (meaning heretyk — En. heretic), no longer used in contemporary Polish. Such words can be, on user’s request, explained and presented in the form ready to be further processed, e.g. translated. Our example, after the new inflected form is applied to the transcribed text, makes the following: which can be understood not only by an ordinary Polish speaker, but also for a machine translation system: Such different textual versions synchronized with image is a valuable source of information for scientific work, e.g. creation of historical dictionaries (see e.g. (Mayenowa et al., 1966 2012)).Poczyna si e historia o pora zce heretyków i zabiciu wodza ich Ksi a  ̨ z ecia de Conde.Begins the story of the failure of heretics and killing their leader the prince de Conde.The process of augmenting the representation has already been started in CBDU. Currently the 300 dpi scanned versions of prints have been supplemented with rich metadata (see Figure 3). Apart from fields considered standard (title transliteration, name of the font used, precise information about the original object and its known copies etc.), the library also contains descriptions going beyond the usual understanding of metadata, thus moving towards interpretation. These set of fields, also represented as metadata, are used to store e.g. additional information about the content, historical comments (concerning facts or people described by the print), relations between library objects (translations, adaptations, alterations of the base text, their alleged sources or derivates etc.) or glossaries providing translations of selected outdated terms or foreign interjections. Several prints have been also commented by media experts and linguists to explain less known background details or presently unintelligible metaphors or symbols. To achieve that, the library installation was from the very beginning used as a collaboration environment for historians, philologists, librarians and computer scientists, allow- ing them to jointly work out and extend metadata content and correct identified omissions on the fly. Proofreading of metadata, linking of objects and storing the newly created specialized print-related content were also carried out in the system, using the workflow defined for the project. What is more, additional fields were used to store expert comments, versioning information etc.Two new directions exploiting the cross-domain, constant- update approach of the library have been followed recently by establishing new project synergies. As for transliteration of the content, initially it was stored in a separate metadata field and was filled in for a single print, for verification only. After possibilities offered by DjVu format for similar content have been recently explored in the IMPACT project (see (Bień, 2011)), the hidden text layer, usually containing the results of Optical Character Recognition, is planned to be used to store the transliteration along with the coordinates of corresponding words on the scanned image. Creat- ing synergy between CBDU and IMPACT, which used the library data for testing OCR algorithms, we plan to supple- ment the CBDU repository of prints with OCR-ed IMPACT data. Transliterated text with word coordinates would also be used to improve user-friendliness of the interface. Glos- saries explaining more difficult terms (see left window in Figure 3), currently stored as separate files and displayed in its entirety, will be used as sources of shorter explana- tory notes shown on user demand in tooltips after pointing the term with a mouse (similarly to triggering thesaurus definitions in Microsoft Word or Open Office). All inflec- tional forms of a term will be automatically detected (cf. (Mykowiecka et al., 2012)). A similar paragraph-based mechanism will be used for presenting text translations. After pointing a foreign, e.g. Latin fragment on a scan, users will be able to display its transliteration and/or translation into Polish. The above-stated approach will be applied in a recently started project of an electronic corpus of 17th and 18th century Polish texts (see http://clip.ipipan.waw. pl/KORBA for details). It intends to be the first stage of supplementing the National Corpus of Polish (Pol: Nar- odowy Korpus J ezyka Polskiego, NKJP, see http:// nkjp.pl/ and (Przepiórkowski et al., 2012)) with old Polish content and covers the so-called middle Polish content, exactly from the years 1601–1772. The corpus will feature annotation for text structure and language (all foreign elements, e.g. Latin intrusions, will be distinguished), and a portion of it will also feature morphological annota- tion. Mutually, the texts transcribed in the course of this project will bring new content to CBDU. We are aware that CBDU resources are still far from com- pleteness. Zawadzki’s bibliography (Zawadzki, 1990) used as a source for object selection in the first phase of our original project does not cover all preserved Polish and Poland-related ephemeral prints. Thanks to development of digital libraries and common access platforms (represented by Digital Libraries Federation 1 in Poland and EU- ROPEANA 2 in Europe) supplementing the material be- came relatively easy. All newly identified objects are suc- cessively acquired by our library by means of storing their metadata and references to external sources. Mirroring content still (unfortunately) requires separate arrangement with libraries preserving the originals.Obviously, for researchers the most important goal of the digital library is making available scanned versions of objects (images, not text) with best possible quality — and this requirement is fulfilled by virtually all digital libraries, including CBDU. What is worthy of attention is that this goal is final for most thematic digital libraries managing manuscripts and old prints. This makes a very serious limi- tation, making it impossible to e.g. automatically search for textual content or reuse (copy-paste) fragments in further research. For less experienced users from the general public it is even more hermetic due to the sheer form of the old print with its fonts (Schwabacher, Fraktur), no longer used abbreviations etc. Language and time barriers create even more problems — our library comprises foreign-language prints, but even old Polish prints can contain many archaic words and syntactic constructs which hinder understand- ability of the text. Foreign-language quotations, particu- larly Latin, pose another challenge. We believe that the thematic digital library should offer far more: different ways of accessing content, suitable for var- ious groups of visitors with different abilities, knowledge and reasons for using the library.Although extending descriptions of stored objects with non-standard interpretation layers goes beyond the present understanding of a “classical” digital library, we have proved that this is the step in the right direction. Whenever a digital library is not intended to purposefully reflect the physical one, the “new type” library can be created, ready to store content closely related to objects (such as relevant1 Pol. Federacja Bibliotek Cyfrowych, see http://fbc. pionier.net.pl/owoc. 2 http://www.europeana.eu/metadata-rich references to other digital libraries, also offered by our project), making partial critical editions and offering fragment translations.

[Obviously, for researchers the most important goal of the digital library is making available scanned versions of objects (images, not text) with best possible quality — and this requirement is fulfilled by virtually all digital libraries, including CBDU. What is worthy of attention is that this goal is final for most thematic digital libraries managing manuscripts and old prints. This makes a very serious limi- tation, making it impossible to e.g. automatically search for textual content or reuse (copy-paste) fragments in further research. For less experienced users from the general public it is even more hermetic due to the sheer form of the old print with its fonts (Schwabacher, Fraktur), no longer used abbreviations etc. Language and time barriers create even more problems — our library comprises foreign-language prints, but even old Polish prints can contain many archaic words and syntactic constructs which hinder understand- ability of the text.
