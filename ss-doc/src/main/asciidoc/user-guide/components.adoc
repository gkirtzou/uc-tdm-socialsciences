=== PDF processing

//Components inside eu.openminted.uc.tdm.socialsciences.io.pdfx

==== PDF to XMI conversion
[[pdf-conversion]]
The PDF-to-XMI conversion pipeline can be used to convert a collection of PDF files to XMI format. This pipeline can be
used via calling the main method:

//TODO create standalone jar for the pipeline as well
 $ java -cp /PATH/TO/ss-io-pdfx-xml-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar eu.openminted.uc.socialsciences.io.pdfx.Pipeline [args...]

The following arguments have to be provided for the program:

* first argument: path to input PDF documents. This path can either point to a single file or a directory.
* second argument (optional): path to output directory. If this argument is not provided output will be written to a
default directory inside the input directory.

When pipeline class starts running it will prompt for the language of the input documents. This parameter is required to
correctly post-process the converted text files (e.g. remove hyphenations inside words that are split into two lines).
This attribute will also be stored in the output XMI files so it can be used in subsequent text analysis components
(e.g. nanmed entity recognition).

=== Named Entity Recognition

[.lead]
With this module, you can perform Named Entity Recognition on your own data.

You can:

* input some annotated data to train your own custom model
* apply a trained model to new, un-annotated data
* evaluate the performance of any model

Training your own model is optional, you might also already have a pre-trained model and use that, or apply a standard
model.

==== Train your own custom model
To train your own custom model, you will need annotated training data.
The training data has to be in TSV format with one token per line, sentences separated by newlines, and annotations
in the second column.
If your training data is in binary CAS format (e.g. exported from WebAnno), you can use the
`BinaryCasToStanfordTsvConverter` to perform the conversion.

*Usage:*

 $ java BinaryCasToStanfordTsvConverter <inputPattern> (<inputLanguageCode>)
 
//TODO correct usage

Use the class StanfordNERTrainer to train the model with this training data. 
You will have to provide a file containing the training properties. 
//TODO we provide default training properties, right?

*Usage:*

 $ java StanfordNERTrainer <propertiesFile> <tsvFile>
 
//TODO correct usage

==== Apply a trained model to new, un-annotated data
With the Pipeline, you can input un-labeled data and apply a NER model to it, such that the output will contain labels
 for all recognized Named Entities.

Input data has to be in XMI (UIMA) format, so if you want to label text from PDF, convert them first
(see <<pdf-conversion,PDF to XMI conversion>>).
You can provide the path to a model in case you pre-trained a model on your own data yourself. 
You can also specify to use one of the pre-trained models that are available (but mind that those models are mostly
trained on newswire text, so if you apply those models to a different domain, the results may have not the quality
you expect).

*Usage:*

 $ java Pipeline <inputDataPattern> <outputPath> (<useStanfordModel>)
 
//TODO correct usage

The results will be written again to XMI files, containing the annotations produced by the Named Entity Recognizer.

==== Evaluate the performance of any model
We also provide a means to evaluate the results of NER. Use `AgreementMeasure` for evaluation. 
You will need gold data, i.e. manually annotated data with the correct NE labels. 
And of course you will need the prediction data, i.e. documents annotated with the NER. 
Both have to be in XMI format again.

*Usage:*

 $ java AgreementMeasure <inputPatternGold> <inputPatternPrediction> (<ignoreDocumentId>)
 
//TODO correct usage
